              Ron Swanson has been the hard boiled director of our Parks
              Department for our quaint town. His honesty and determination have
              kept our team afloat in many a storm. He is passionate about wood
              working and all meats, except fish which he doesn't consider a
              meat.

              much! Her passion and drive is the beating heart of our department
              and the greatest motivator of our team. She admires everything
              about government and bureaucracy, aspires to be an inspiration to
              little girls everywhere, and hopes to show that government can be
              a force for good.
