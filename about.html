              Ron Swanson has been the hard boiled director of our Parks
              Department for our quaint town. His honesty and determination have
              kept our team afloat in many a storm. He is passionate about wood
              working and all meats, except fish which he doesn't consider a
              meat.

              about government and bureaucracy, aspires to be an inspiration to
              little girls everywhere, and hopes to show that government can be
              a force for good.
